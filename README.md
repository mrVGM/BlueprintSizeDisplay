# Blueprint Size Display plugin for the Unreal Engine editor

A small toolbar widget, that shows the size of the blueprint, that is currently being edited.
It updates everytime the asset gets saved, so one can track how the size changes. Hence can easily notice, if they have accidentally added an unwanted hard reference to some other (heavy) blueprint.
Essentially, it's an extremely simple version of the Unreal's Size Map window, which shows only the size of the blueprint, that is currently opened.
Its benefit is, that it is always visible at the toolbar.


To install the tool simply clone the repo inside the 'Plugins' folder of your project and restart the Editor. 


Here is what it looks like:
